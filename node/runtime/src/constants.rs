// for operational ones). `TARGET_BLOCK_FULLNESS` is entirely independent and the system module is
// not aware of if, nor should it care about it. This constant simply denotes on which ratio of the
// _maximum_ block weight we tweak the fees. It does NOT care about the type of the dispatch.
//
// For the system to be configured in a sane way, `TARGET_BLOCK_FULLNESS` should always be less than
