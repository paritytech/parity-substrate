//! # Scored Pool Module
//!
//! The module maintains a scored membership pool. Each entity in the
//! pool can be attributed a `Score`. From this pool a set `Members`
//! is constructed. This set contains the `MemberCount` highest
//! scoring entities. Unscored entities are never part of `Members`.
//!
//! If an entity wants to be part of the pool a deposit is required.
//! The deposit is returned when the entity withdraws (or when it
//! is removed by an entity with the appropriate authority).
//!
//! Every `Period` blocks the set of `Members` is refreshed from the
//! highest scoring members in the pool and, no matter if changes
//! occurred, `T::MembersChanged::change_members` is invoked.
//!
//! It is possible to withdraw candidacy/resign your membership at any
//! time. If an entity is currently a member, this results in removal
//! from the `Pool` and `Members` and the entity is immediately replaced
//! by the next highest scoring candidate in the pool, if available.
//!
//! - [`scored_pool::Trait`](./trait.Trait.html)
//! - [`Call`](./enum.Call.html)
//! - [`Module`](./struct.Module.html)
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! ### Public Functions
//!
//! - `issue_candidacy` - Issue candidacy to become a member. Requires a deposit.
//! - `withdraw_candidacy` - Withdraw candidacy. Deposit is returned.
//! - `score` - Attribute a quantitative score to an entity.
//! - `kick` - Remove an entity from the pool and members. Deposit is returned.
//! - `change_member_count` - Changes the amount of candidates taken into `Members`.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use srml_support::{decl_module, dispatch::Result};
//! use system::ensure_signed;
//! use srml_scored_pool::{self as scored_pool};
//!
//! pub trait Trait: scored_pool::Trait {}
//!
//! decl_module! {
//! 	pub struct Module<T: Trait> for enum Call where origin: T::Origin {
//! 		pub fn candidate(origin) -> Result {
//! 			let who = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//!
//! 			let _ = <scored_pool::Module<T>>::issue_candidacy(
//! 				T::Origin::from(Some(who.clone()).into())
//! 			);
//! 			Ok(())
//! 		}
//! 	}
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Dependencies
//!
//! This module depends on the [System module](../srml_system/index.html).

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.
